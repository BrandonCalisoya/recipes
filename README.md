my english is regular, sorry for that.. but i'll try to explain how i made this :3

first of all, i learned to write commands in the bash, things how 
-mv to move something
-cp to copy files, but if i want to copy more files, i need the option -r
-remove to remove o kill a file, with -r can remove a whole folder :o its dangerous

cd to drive between files, using ../ or (insert file's direction) include ~ for go to start side

then im learned about html, but i was learned about this, now im trying to learn more html. 
<!--this to make a comment -->

and more...

i know that all i learned its more than this, but read my words.... its killing inside me ty odin :3
