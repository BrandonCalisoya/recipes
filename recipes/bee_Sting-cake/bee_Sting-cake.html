                <p class="description-bee">This German bee sting cake is my boyfriend's and my favorite. It has a bread-like crust with a
                    sugary-almond
                    crunchy topping and a vanilla pudding filling. Mmm... A must-try dessert!</p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol class="list-steps">
                <li>
                    <h1>step 1</h1>
                    <p> Combine flour, yeast, 2 tablespoons sugar, salt, 3/4 cup milk, and 3 tablespoons butter in a
                        large
                        bowl. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 15 to
                        20
                        minutes. Place in a well-greased bowl; cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until
                        doubled. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>step 2</h2>
                    <p>Punch down dough. Roll out to a 1/2-inch thickness. Spread into a greased 8-inch square baking
                        pan.
                        Cover and let rise for 30 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>step 3</h2>
                    <p> Melt 3 tablespoons butter and confectioners' sugar in a saucepan. Add almonds and 1 tablespoon
                        milk.
                        Remove from heat, and stir in honey. Spread evenly and carefully onto dough. Allow dough to rise
                        for
                        an additional 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>step 4</h2>
                    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until crust turns golden brown. Cool
                        completely
                        on a wire rack. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>step 5</h2>
                    <p> Dissolve cornstarch in a little milk. Combine 1 1/2 cups milk, cornstarch, and 1 tablespoon
                        sugar in
                        the top of a double boiler. Heat while stirring until thickened, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add in
                        beaten
                        egg, and keep stirring for about 2 more minutes, or until thick. Remove from heat and stir in
                        extract. Chill, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Beat whipping cream with cream
                        of
                        tartar until stiff. Fold into chilled pudding. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>step 6</h2>
                    <p> Cut cooled almond bread into 1 1/4x2-inch rectangles; slice each one horizontally into halves.
                        Fill
                        with pudding mixture. Chill, and serve cold. </p>
