            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <li>
                <h1>step 1</h1>
                <p> For sauce base, first toast chilies: heat a dry griddle or skillet over medium heat. Toast guajillo
                    chilies and chiles de arbol, turning often, until fragrant and lightly browned, being careful not to
                    burn them. Place chilies in a bowl, cover them with boiling water, and soak until reconstituted,
                    about 30 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>step 2</h1>
                <p> Meanwhile, heat oil over medium heat in a large pan. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until soft,
                    about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook until they break down, about 5 minutes. Let the mixture cool.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>step 3</h1>
                <p> Place peppercorns, cloves, dried ginger, cumin seeds, thyme, marjoram, and oregano in a mortar and
                    grind into a fine mix. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>step 4</h1>
                <p> In a blender, combine soaked chilies, 1/4 cup of the chile soaking liquid, onion-tomato mix, ground
                    spices, chicken bouillon, and apple cider vinegar. Blend until smooth. Add a small amount of beef
                    broth if needed for blending. Taste sauce; season with salt. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>step 5</h1>
                <p> To cook meat, place chuck roast, beef shanks, and beef short ribs in a large pot and pour the sauce
                    over it. Add enough beef broth to cover meat by about 1 inch, then stir to combine. Bring to a boil
                    over high heat, then add cinnamon stick, onion, garlic, and bay leaves. Cover, and reduce heat to
                    low, and simmer until meat is tender and falling apart, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove and discard short
                    rib bones; skim fat from surface of broth using a spoon. Reserve fat for another use, such as
                    quesabirrias. Taste broth; season with salt. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>step 6</h1>
                <p> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add ramen, and cook until tender, 7 to 20 minutes, or
                    according to package instructions. Drain; divide noodles into bowls. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>step 7</h1>
                <p> To assemble the dish, ladle birria and broth over ramen. Top with chopped onion and cilantro. Serve
                    with lime wedges. </p>
            </li>
