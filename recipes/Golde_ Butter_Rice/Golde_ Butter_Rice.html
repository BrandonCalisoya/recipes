    <p>This golden butter rice, flavored with ginger and turmeric, is a forgotten way of cooking butter rice. It isn't
        cooked rice with butter stirred in, it really is rice cooked in butter. This is my favorite version, with
        seasonings inspired by a classic Indian drink called golden milk.</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>step1</h2>
                <p> Melt butter in a pan or pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. As soon as butter starts to
                    bubble, add in ginger, turmeric, cayenne, brown sugar, and salt. Cook, whisking, for 1 minute. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>step2</h2>
                <p> Add rice, and stir until every grain is coated with butter. Stir in water, and bring to a boil over
                    high heat. As soon as it begins to boil, gently shake and swirl the pan to settle rice into an even
                    layer, then reduce heat to medium-low. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>step3</h2>
                <p> Cover tightly and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off heat, and let rest, covered, for 10 minutes. DO
                    NOT lift the lid or try to stir yet. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>step4</h2>
                <p> Now, remove the lid and use a fork to fluff and separate rice grains. Season to taste, and serve
                    immediately, garnished with walnuts and green onions. </p>
